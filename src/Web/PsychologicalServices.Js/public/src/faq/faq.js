            {'question': 'What is the difference between a Neuropsychological Assessment vs a Neurological Assessment?', 'answer': `Neuropsychological Assessments measure cognition, including memory, attention, and visual motor abilities using standardized testing with comparisons made to persons of same sex, age, or education. It also speaks to the severity of the same and their impact on functioning. Emotional functioning and personality are assessed using standardized testing. Validity issues, including measures of malingering are also assessed using standardized testing.
            Neurology Assessments deal with abnormalities of the nervous system (ie. Illness, injuries, structural changes) and infers cognitive deficits, but typically does not directly test. This type of assessment does not include validity measures.`},
            {'question': 'What is the difference between a Psychological Asssessment and a Psychiatric Assessment?', 'answer': `Psychological Evaluations assess personality and emotional functioning using standardized, objective measures with comparisons made to persons of same sex, age, or education as warranted.

            Psychiatric Evaluations also include clinical interviews, and may include some standardized measures of emotional functioning.`},
            {'question': 'What is a Psychological Injury?', 'answer': `Legally, a psychological injury is considered mental harm, suffering, damage, impairment, or dysfunction caused to a person as a direct result of some action or failure to act by some individual. The psychological injury must reach a degree of disturbance of the pre-existing psychological/ psychiatric state such that it interferes in some significant way with the individual's ability to function.  It is essential that Psychologists undertake comprehensive, impartial and scientifically informed assessments when presenting evidence with respect to psychological injury and consideration of the degree of influence pre-existing mental health conditions present to the claim.
            Typically, a psychological injury may involve Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), a concussion, chronic pain, or a disorder that involves mood or emotions (such as depression, anxiety, fear, or phobia, and adjustment disorder). These disorders may manifest separately or in combination (co-morbidity) with another injury.`},
            {'question': 'Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder', 'answer': 'Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a severe anxiety disorder that can develop after exposure to any event that results in psychological trauma, overwhelming the individual\'s ability to cope.  In cases of valid presentation of PTSD, psychologists can help patients deal with their condition by applying specialized cognitive behavioral techniques.'},
            {'question': 'Chronic Pain', 'answer': 'The "biopsychosocial approach" to chronic pain recognizes the influence of psychological factors (e.g., stress) on pain. Along with the biological components of pain (i.e. central sensitization), there is an integration with psychological factors (including catastrophizing, fear avoidance beliefs, and self-efficacy) as well as social factors (such as occupation, relationships, and culture.)'},
            {'question': 'Traumatic Brain Injury', 'answer': 'Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) refers to mild to severe pathophysiological effects in the brain and central nervous system due to strong impacts, such as severe blows to the head and penetrating wounds that might take place in accidents and other events at claim. Neuropsychological deficits associated with TBI include those relating to memory, concentration, attention, processing speed, reasoning, problem solving, planning, and inhibitory control. When these effects persist, other psychological difficulties might arise, even in mild cases (such as concussions).'},
            {'question': 'Disability and Return to Work', 'answer': 'When psychological injuries compromise daily activities, psychologists need to address the degree of disability Patients express symptoms that might be accurately diagnosed as PTSD, Pain Disorder, and/or TBI. However, the critical issue is the degree of impairment, limitation, and participation restriction in daily activities in which patients would normally participate at work, at home, in childcare, and in schooling. When the patient cannot undertake the functions involved in these important roles, the psychologist or other mental health professional may conclude that a disability is present, but this cannot be ascertained by the mere presence of a diagnosis of one sort or another. Rather, the psychologist must demonstrate that the person is disabled from the essential duties, tasks, or activities of the role at issue.'}
