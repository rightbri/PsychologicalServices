              Dr. Robert Heilbronner, Ph.D. ABPP-CN, was quoted as saying: 
              </p>
              <blockquote class="uk-text-small uk-margin-left">
                <p>
                “A neuropsychologist is an expert in the effects or real or suspected brain dysfunction and its impact on thinking skills, emotions, or behavior.”
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              
              <p>
              Dr. Kristie Nies, PhD, ABPP-CN was quoted providing the following answer: 
              </p>
              <blockquote class="uk-text-small uk-margin-left">
                <p>
                “A: I evaluate how someone’s brain is working, or not working. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Q: How do you do that? 
                </p>
                <p>
                A: A variety of tests have been developed that are known to measure certain areas of the brain. We know how people without neurological injuries and diseases perform on these tests. So when I see a patient, I give them these tests, and compare them to people of their same age and education to make it fair, and it tells me if there is an impairment and to what degree they are impaired. Then, within the context of the onset and the course of symptoms, I determine if it all hangs together.”
